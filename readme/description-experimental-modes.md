### Experimental Modes ###

The pro version has two experimental modes.

#### Lazyload -> Fullscreen ####

This is sort of a dream come true because to me it never really made sense to watch videos in small boxes in the middle of the page, lightboxes are half way there but why not go straight to fullscreen? You now can. There is a issue though and that is the fact that technically this uses the HTML 5 fullscreen feature on the iframe with the video in it. This means if you click the fullscreen button from the Fullscreen it goes to fullscreen and 2nd time. When flash gets involved this can end up in some even more weird behavior.

#### Lazyload -> Fixed ####

This opens up the video in a risizable (making it smaller only works in Firefox) fixed element on the page with the video.
